# Notes Android App

# I designed and developed a simple Notes Android app with the following features:

* Single Activity Structure: The app is built using a single activity, with different screens managed through fragments, ensuring a modular and maintainable architecture.

* Google+ Login: The app initiates with a login screen if the user is not logged in. Login is exclusive via Google+, and user sessions are tracked using SharedPreferences or SQLite, ensuring a seamless and secure login experience.

* Notes Display: Upon successful login, the app displays all notes associated with the logged-in user. The notes are presented in full detail using a RecyclerView, providing a smooth and user-friendly interface for managing notes.

* Add Note: Users can easily add new notes through a dedicated button, enabling efficient note-taking directly within the app.

* Update Note: The app allows users to update existing notes, ensuring that information remains current and editable.

* Delete Note: Users can delete notes as needed, allowing for effective note management and organization.

# This app demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a functional and user-centric note-taking application on Android.
